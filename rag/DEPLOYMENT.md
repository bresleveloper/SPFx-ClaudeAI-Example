# SharePoint Deployment Guide for ShitzelSPFx

**Package**: `sharepoint/solution/shitzel-sp-fx.sppkg` (210 KB)
**Date**: October 17, 2025
**SPFx Version**: 1.19.0

---

## Critical Fix Applied

### Previous Issue
Both webparts failed to load with error:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
```

### Root Cause
The previous deployment had stale build artifacts and wasn't properly installed in the App Catalog with full trust permissions.

### Solution Implemented
1. Cleaned all build artifacts (`gulp clean`)
2. Removed old .sppkg package
3. Rebuilt solution from scratch
4. Created fresh production bundle (no duplicates)
5. Verified bundle integrity

---

## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Remove Old Version (CRITICAL)

**In SharePoint Admin Center:**

1. Navigate to: **More features** → **Apps** → **Open** (under Apps)
2. Click **Apps for SharePoint**
3. Find "shitzel-sp-fx" in the list
4. Click the **...** menu → **Remove**
5. Confirm removal

**Why this matters**: SharePoint caches manifests aggressively. Removing the old app clears all cached manifest data.

---

### Phase 2: Upload New Package

**In App Catalog:**

1. Navigate to: **App Catalog** → **Apps for SharePoint**
2. Click **Upload** or drag-and-drop file
3. Select: `C:\Users\Administrator\source\repos\shitzelSPFx\sharepoint\solution\shitzel-sp-fx.sppkg`
4. In the dialog that appears:
   - [x] Check "Make this solution available to all sites in the organization"
   - [x] Check "Enable this app"
5. Click **Deploy**

**You MUST see this permission dialog:**
```
This app requires permission to resources in your organization.
Do you trust shitzel-sp-fx?
```

6. **CRITICAL**: Click **Trust It**

If you don't see the trust dialog, the app won't work!

### Phase 3: Verify Installation

**Check App Status:**

1. Stay in App Catalog → **Apps for SharePoint**
2. Find "shitzel-sp-fx-client-side-solution"
3. Verify status shows: **Deployed**
4. Check deployment date matches today

**Check Assets Uploaded:**

1. Go to: **Site Contents** → **ClientSideAssets** (document library)
2. You should see new files uploaded with today's timestamp:
   - `shintzel-doughnut-web-part_e51f09f757cc293550bb.js` (596 KB)
   - `shintzel-table-web-part_6f340a78be7eee5d270c.js` (79 KB)
   - `ShintzelTableWebPartStrings_en-us_*.js` (~1 KB)

If these files aren't there, the package didn't deploy correctly.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "This app can't be added to this site"

**Cause**: App not deployed tenant-wide
**Fix**:
1. Go back to App Catalog
2. Click on the app → **Properties**
3. Check "Make available to all sites"
4. Click **Save**

### Issue: Webparts don't appear in webpart picker

**Cause**: Site hasn't synced with App Catalog
**Fix**:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes
2. Refresh the page
3. Try incognito/private browsing mode
4. Clear browser cache

### Issue: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')"

**Cause 1**: Old cached version
**Fix**: Remove app completely from App Catalog and redeploy

**Cause 2**: Assets didn't upload
**Fix**: Check ClientSideAssets library for bundle files

**Cause 3**: Permissions not granted
**Fix**: Redeploy and click "Trust It" when prompted

### Issue: Chart doesn't render / shows spinner forever

**Possible Causes**:
1. **List doesn't exist**: Verify `ProcApprvlShnitzel3` list exists
2. **Field doesn't exist**: Verify status field internal name is correct
3. **No permissions**: Site collection app permissions needed
4. **No data**: List might be empty

**Debug Steps**:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for HTTP errors (401, 403, 404)
3. Check SharePoint REST API response:
   ```
   https://[tenant].sharepoint.com/sites/[site]/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('ProcApprvlShnitzel3')/items
   ```
4. Verify you can access the list manually

### Issue: Table shows "Error Loading Data"

**Check**:
1. List name is correct (case-sensitive)
2. User has permissions to read list
3. List has items
4. Network connectivity
