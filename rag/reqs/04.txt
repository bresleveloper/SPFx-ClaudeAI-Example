you created shintzelDoughnut and shintzelTable

they do not look like the spec in rag/MyChosenGUI.md

ultrathink and fix it.

do all changes needed but as html/css only, the rest is working, so dont ruin

you also need to manage background in the webparts level.

read the images in `rag/reqs/imgs`. 
`12 res.png` -> is current result. 
`2025-10-17 12_26_40-Live Demo - Free HTML Templates Live Demo - HTML Codex.png` -> is from demo, that is how the ui of table webparts should look like. 

you can also remove the checkbox from the table, and the button column.
the headers should also be the Fields Display Names.
