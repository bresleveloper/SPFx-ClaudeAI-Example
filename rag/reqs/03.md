i want to create 2 spfx webparts.

1. shintzelTable (exist, clean)
2. shintzelDoughnut (need to create new spfx webpart)

### shintzelTable

need to present all items from current web list with title "ProcApprvlShnitzel3".
should show only custom fields + Title + Created.

### shintzelDoughnut
there is a field "_x05e1__x05d8__x05d8__x05d5__x05" or "OData__x05e1__x05d8__x05d8__x05d5__x05", which is a status field, with fixed options.

that would be the Doughnut category, also the part in the Doughnut for value "אושר ע"י המשתמש" shoudl be green.


## instuctions

* create spfx 1.19.0 webparts, detailed how-to is in `rag/spfx.1.19.0.md`
* further details about using sharepoint rest api in `rag/SP_RestApi.md`
* the details UI html/css for the webparst is in `rag/MyChosenGUI.md`
* do not use any addons, dependencies, libraries, ect, the solution should be super simple, html + css + few REST requests and you should be done. use only tools given by spfx.1.19.0, typescipt, js , html5, css3

ultrathink, do not write any code, write your plan to `rag/plan.md`
