# fixing font problems:

## this is the prompt of the original 06.txt

shintzelDoughnut and shintzelTable.

font color everywhere should be #6C7293. titles color #fff.
bigger x1.6 font size of everything.

for the table itself 
    table:
        text-align: right;

    cells:
        border-color: #000;
        border-style: solid;
        border-width: 0 1px;
    rows:
        border-color: #000;
        border-style: solid;
        border-width: 1px 0;


you need to read the html structre of the webparts to understand what element is actually representing the table, rows, cells, title, and content fonts.







## but....
didnt work, asked claude "why is this not working? ultrathink", got response

```
  The Problem:

  Your HTML template strings used plain class names like class="doughnut-chart-container", but SPFx SCSS modules
  automatically hash/scope classes (e.g., .doughnut-chart-container becomes .doughnut-chart-container_abc123). The HTML
  couldn't find the hashed classes.

  The Fix:

  Wrapped all classes used in HTML with :global() to prevent scoping:
  ....//fixes with :global()
```
